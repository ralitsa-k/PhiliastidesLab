# Cleaning and maintenance {#cleaning-and-maintenance}

* Clean the caps gently, very useful to use cotton pads, or simply the tap pressure to remove the gel.
* Clean the working station. 
* Wipe the gel container. 
* If the gel is half empty or less, it is difficult to take it out, and it gets messy. Mix two gels in one container to make it easier to get the gel out.
