If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

Fill again. Go inside, attach to amps. Green = Amp1, yellow = Amp2. Amps on. Check Ground, Ref, forehead (fix) Check impedance at 0-100, then 0-50, and 0-20 scale. Fix half head - fill with gel. Fix other half - fill with gel. Repeat rub and fill if necessary. Show teeth clenching and eye squeeze. Eye-calibration. Save impedance. Start task. Steps detailed: Sit the participant on a chair outside the booth. Measure head circumference just above the eyebrows. Measure the position of Cz electrode. Take the middle point between the nasion and the inion and mark it. Take the middle point between the ears and align with the first point, make a bigger mark on the skin. Use the cap with appropriate size and position by adjusting Cz, so that the mark is visible. Pull the cap down tight, strap, and if necessary use the chest strap. Clean the skin above the left eyebrow, just left of the chin, and behind the left ear with alcohol wipes. Attach the stickers to the 3 loose electrodes and attach the electrodes to the cleaned areas. Fill wach electrode with a syringe by holding pushin the electrodes close to the head, do not use too much gel. Avoid connecting electrodes with hair strands. Rub each hole with a cotton bud. Fill each electrode once again. Go inside the booth and attach the amp1 to the cable with green dot and amp2 to the cable with yellow. Turn the amps on. Check the ground, reference, and forehead impedance. Go to Data and check the impedance of the rest of the electrodes by changing the scale from 0-100, then 0-50, and then 0-20 Aim for green/yellow dots by sideways motion (separates hair), or circling motion (rubs gel), or 360 degree motion (consistently improves impedance). Show the participant the monitoring mode to explain what clencing the teeth, and squeezing the eyes does, and why it should be avoided. Staying with their teeth slightly apart helps. Explain what the blinks should be during the eye calibration, then play the eye calibration scenario Save impedances by following the instructions by Brain Vision. Do the experiment.

Clean the working station. Wipe the gel container. If the gel is half empty or less, it is difficult to take it out, and it gets messy. Mix two gels in one container to make it easier to get the gel out. "],["preprocessing.html", "Chapter 4 Preprocessing steps", " Chapter 4 Preprocessing steps Ralie: 1. Run events_from_csv.R in Z:/TOOLS/RiPE_soc/Beha_check This is the behavioural file which sends the events to the EEG machine. This step is to compare sent and received events later in Matlab. This creates a csv file in each participant folder named dat_all_triggers.csv In EEG_preprocess folder. Open extract_port_events.m Choose appropriate triggers, and rename the fields of the struct with _onset, and _id. This creates a .m files named ‘all_events_and_behav_socRiPE.m’ (in my case). Open preprocess_brainamp_data.m Fix the name of the .eeg file, initials of participants, etc. and run the script. This creates LP_socRiPE_filtered.mat (for example, for subject LP). Run Epoch data. epoch = Should be defined as the name of the field of the structure that is of interest. faces_onset in my case. This produces data epoched according to the offset values.
